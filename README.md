The iPSC technology was pioneered by Shinya Yamanakaâ€™s lab in Kyoto, Japan. 

Induced pluripotent stem cells are a type of pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from a somatic cell. 

In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka demonstrated the use of four specific genes, encoding transcription factors, could convert somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells. 

He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize along with Sir John Gurdon for the discovery that "mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent."
