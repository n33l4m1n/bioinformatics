The iPSC technology was pioneered by Shinya Yamanaka’s lab in Kyoto, Japan. 

Induced pluripotent stem cells are a type of pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from a somatic cell. 

In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka demonstrated the use of four specific genes, encoding transcription factors, could convert somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells. 

He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize along with Sir John Gurdon for the discovery that "mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent."

1. OCT4 (POU5F1)
Function: OCT4 is a transcription factor that is crucial for the maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) pluripotency. It helps in keeping ESCs in a self-renewable and undifferentiated state.
Significance: It is heavily studied in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, playing a pivotal role in cellular reprogramming techniques, like the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

2. SOX2
Function: SOX2 is also a transcription factor that collaborates with OCT4 to maintain the pluripotency and self-renewal of ESCs.
Significance: Along with OCT4, it is instrumental in reprogramming differentiated cells back to a stem cell-like state (iPSCs), which has revolutionary implications in regenerative medicine and understanding developmental biology.

3. Klf2 (Kruppel-like factor 2)
Function: Klf2 is involved in regulating stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency as well. It is also involved in various processes such as embryonic development and blood vessel formation (angiogenesis).
Significance: Understanding the role of Klf2 in cellular processes is essential to harness stem cells' therapeutic potential and understand certain diseases better, like cardiovascular diseases.

4. c-Myc
Function: c-Myc is an oncogene and a transcription factor that plays roles in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cellular transformation.
Significance: It’s one of the Yamanaka factors used in cellular reprogramming to generate iPSCs. It is also a significant gene studied in cancer biology due to its role in cell proliferation and growth.

Significance:
When used together, OCT4, SOX2, Klf2, and c-Myc are powerful tools in cellular reprogramming, often used to generate iPSCs from somatic cells, allowing researchers to create patient-specific stem cells for studying diseases and potential therapeutic interventions, such as drug testing and transplantation therapies. The understanding and manipulation of these genes have been revolutionary in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.
